		<p>I am glad to have you on my website. This website includes all the stated requirements such as header and body section that includes some text, at least one image, and at least one table. It has also an external CSS file that is properly linked to the webpage that includes at least 5 different classes or IDs that modify elements of the linked webpage. One of the classes or IDs control layout using layers (Div tag), and the rest modify properties such as fonts, colors, background-color, etc.</p>
